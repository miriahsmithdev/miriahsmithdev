<h2>About Me 👽</h2>
<p>I'm a full-stack developer with a not-so-secret love affair with the front-end. I believe in the importance of the human element in design, so UX/UI and accessibility are always top priorities in my work.</p>
<p><strong>🎨 UX/UI Enthusiast:</strong> I strive to create interfaces that are not only functional but also intuitive and enjoyable to use.</p>
<p><strong>♿️ Accessibility Advocate:</strong> Ensuring that web applications are accessible to everyone is a key part of my development process.</p>
<p><strong>🧩 Problem Solver:</strong>I enjoy piecing together different elements of code to create efficient and elegant solutions.</p>
<br>
<p>Outside of coding, I spend time with my three dogs - Thor, Galadriel, and Moose - and enjoy creating both digital and traditional art. Feel free to explore my repositories to see what I've been working on!</p>
